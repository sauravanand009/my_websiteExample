1
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,315
<i> I killed</i>
<i> a lot of guys.</i>

2
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:28,620
<i> They were</i>
<i> worthless pieces of shit,</i>

3
00:01:28,622 --> 00:01:31,123
<i> but I killed them,</i>

4
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:33,592
<i> and you're not supposed</i>
<i> to kill people.</i>

5
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:36,695
<i> So what happened to me?</i>

6
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:39,698
<i> I guess maybe</i>
<i> in the end...</i>

7
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,669
<i> It was a lot better</i>
<i> than what I deserved.</i>

8
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,574
<i> But it takes a long time</i>
<i> to work that out.</i>

9
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:53,879
<i> In the meantime,</i>
<i> you just want to get even.</i>

10
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:21,273
hello, Dr. Jane,
I'm Dr. galen.

11
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:25,878
As you know, I'm here to conduct
an interview on your status,

12
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,412
see how you're doing.

13
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:29,815
Dr. Ralph galen.

14
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:34,219
I only recently
found out my case is
under your supervision.

15
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:36,155
Correct.

16
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:37,723
A chair please, Hector.

17
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:41,226
I'll probably be here
about a week.

18
00:02:41,228 --> 00:02:42,461
All for me?

19
00:02:42,463 --> 00:02:44,730
All for you.

20
00:02:44,732 --> 00:02:46,398
As a professional courtesy,

21
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,201
I will refer to you
as<i> doctor</i> even though--

22
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:52,538
even though I've lost
my medical license.

23
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,375
I suppose I should thank you
for your good manners.

24
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:59,811
Well, shall we
get started?

25
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:03,782
Nearly two years ago,
on the night of November 22nd,

26
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:06,852
the sfpd received
an anonymous call

27
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,720
which lead them
to investigate

28
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:11,757
what proved to be
multiple murder,

29
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,260
<i> four dead bodies,</i>
<i> and you unconscious--</i>

30
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:18,630
yes, yes, yes. We all
know about my condition.

31
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:22,601
Unconscious on
an operating table.

32
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:24,970
It turned out that you
had set up an illegal

33
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:28,207
off-the-books surgical clinic
where you performed--

34
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:30,542
illegal,
off-the-books operations

35
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:34,279
on those unfortunates
who wanted and needed
medical help

36
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:37,416
but couldn't afford
the outrageous costs.

37
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:40,886
An empty gun
was found in the hand

38
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,355
<i> of your surgical assistant,</i>
<i> Albert Becker--</i>

39
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:45,591
the gun belonged
to frank kitchen.

40
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:51,463
And the, uh,
ballistics evidence
from Becker's gun

41
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:53,465
matched the bullets taken
from the dead bodies

42
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:55,500
as well as the bullet
in your chest.

43
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:59,771
You were arrested,
charged with multiple crimes,

44
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:03,008
and at a hearing you were found
mentally unfit for trial.

45
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,876
Absolute bullshit.

46
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:07,846
The presiding judge
stipulated that you were

47
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:10,482
to be periodically
evaluated and that,

48
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:12,484
at the point,
if and when you were judged

49
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:14,920
to have fully regained
your faculties,

50
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:17,689
you would be returned
to the remand

51
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:20,792
of the district attorney,
city of San Francisco,

52
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:23,395
and bound over
for prosecution.

53
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:25,030
Do you feel relieved,

54
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:27,699
now that you've gotten
all that off your shoulders?

55
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:35,040
Well, first,
I'm especially interested

56
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:37,276
in your relationship
and involvement

57
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:40,412
with your brother,
uh, Sebastian.

58
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:43,282
We were close.

59
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,386
He was a very
special person.

60
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,631
La la la...

61
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,808
Yo. Whitney.

62
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,977
You-- your money's
on the table.

63
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,046
Go home.

64
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:16,081
And by the way,
you failed miserably

65
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,582
at your chosen vocation.

66
00:05:17,584 --> 00:05:20,919
There wasn't a shred
of stimulation.

67
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:23,622
Get the fuck out!

68
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:26,458
I have a copy
of the NYPD's complete file

69
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,959
on your brother's case.

70
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:30,562
I-- I doubt you've
had access to it.

71
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,971
You'll have
to turn the pages
for me, won't you?

72
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:42,808
-Ah.
-Thanks to your ridiculous
security requirements.

73
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:47,679
-Yeah.
-Unless, in the name of mercy,
you could untie the bindings.

74
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:50,082
I'd still be in your
medieval straightjacket,

75
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:52,084
but at least I'd have
some degree of control

76
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:54,853
over the movement
of my arms.

77
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,856
Mmm.

78
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:12,604
Ha. Oh. Mm-hmm.

79
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:17,509
La la la...

80
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,396
Hey, maybe
you don't get it.

81
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:38,930
Or maybe
your bosses don't.

82
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:42,067
You kill me, you never
get that money back. Never!

83
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:44,503
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry!

84
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:55,714
As you can see, the proper
authorities conducted

85
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:57,716
a full investigation.

86
00:06:57,718 --> 00:07:01,653
The murder of your brother
Sebastian was obviously
a professional job.

87
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:07,492
I paid a lot
of money to discover
the killer's identity.

88
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:09,795
He's a lifetime criminal
who goes by the name

89
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:11,129
of frank kitchen.

90
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:12,497
Mm-hmm.

91
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,466
There were rumors
that some form

92
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:16,902
of street justice
may have been handed out,

93
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:19,171
but the death
of Sebastian Jane

94
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:21,940
remains an unsolved murder.

95
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,075
It's now a cold case.

96
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:28,580
I'm guessing that's been...
Troubling for you?

97
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,618
Assuming there is
such a person,

98
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,122
I want to talk a bit more
about this frank kitchen.

99
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,825
Why would you think
there's no frank kitchen?

100
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:41,626
I mean, don't be an idiot.

101
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,629
You actually think
i made him up?

102
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:32,177
I need a room.

103
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,751
If I need maid service,
I'll let you know.

104
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:45,717
Yeah?

105
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,854
Yeah, I just checked in.

106
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:57,896
Yeah.

107
00:09:57,898 --> 00:10:00,265
Uh, room 308.

108
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:17,616
Let's talk for a minute
about honest John baconian.

109
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:20,619
You obviously found
him useful.

110
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:23,121
"Honest" John baconian?

111
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:26,658
"Good king, great king,
and yet not greatly good."

112
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,128
Do you read Shakespeare?

113
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,230
Of course not.

114
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:34,165
Why do I even ask?

115
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:37,902
<i> Richard ii,</i> act iv.

116
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:40,038
Honest John baconian,

117
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,309
was there ever a man
with a more disingenuous name?

118
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:47,746
Such a darwinian creature.

119
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:50,782
Right. According
to your initial statements
to the police,

120
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:53,284
in the past this honest John
supplied you with

121
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:56,988
impoverished homeless people
against their will

122
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,725
so that you could perform
deviant medical experiments
on them--

123
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:04,129
I did conduct experiments
to further human knowledge

124
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:06,765
in areas most fear to go.

125
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:09,134
And I harmed no one
of any value.

126
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:12,170
You should change
your line of questioning.

127
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,375
It's good
to see you, Frankie.

128
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:20,845
It's been a while.

129
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:23,748
It's two years since
we've done business.

130
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,184
But you're stayin'
in a dump.

131
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,919
Frankie does great work.

132
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:29,854
Just flew in from Miami.

133
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,757
I called him and he came
in as fast as he could.

134
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:35,994
I appreciate that
because it shows respect.

135
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:41,066
You fucking backstabbing
motherfucking chinky.

136
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:43,368
I don't trust you,
but I love you.

137
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:47,105
Now I come all the way
down here from my office

138
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:50,241
to your shitty room to impress
on you how important this is,

139
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:53,078
how important this is to me.

140
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,113
This man, Benny Hong Lee,

141
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:57,382
the one we brought
you here to take care of,

142
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:01,019
this fuckin' chinaman
stole my money,

143
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:04,789
and now he's trying
to steal my entire operation,

144
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:07,726
this business that I worked
my entire life to build.

145
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:09,928
He wants to take it
away just like that.

146
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,030
But we got a problem.

147
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:15,834
He left town
for a week, Vegas.

148
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:17,836
I promised my friends
that I wouldn't do

149
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:19,370
my laundry
in their backyard,

150
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:21,740
and I always
keep my promise.

151
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:24,909
That's why they call me
honest John, right?

152
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,445
So we wait.

153
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:29,948
Give him the bag.

154
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,126
That's $25,000.

155
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:46,231
You sit, you wait a week,
you do the work.

156
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:47,932
No mistakes.

157
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,896
You ever wanna get
together again,

158
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:59,530
this is how you get
ahold of me.

159
00:14:59,532 --> 00:15:01,499
Just give me a call.

160
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:08,606
My name is Johnnie,
in case you forgot.

161
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:12,610
Where you from,
Johnnie?

162
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:14,946
A long way from here.

163
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:16,948
That's it,
no more questions.

164
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:22,620
Yeah, well... I'm gonna
leave town real soon.

165
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:28,192
Don't worry about it.
It's no big deal.

166
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:53,351
I had forgotten about
her Shakespeare obsession.

167
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:55,219
First thing she did
after she got here

168
00:15:55,221 --> 00:15:57,188
was send for
the complete works.

169
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,023
You got a little blast
of it, huh?

170
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:02,226
Yes, my inability to recognize
a quote from<i> Richard ii</i>

171
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:05,296
was held to be
an unforgivable fault.

172
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,265
She's constantly
reminding me

173
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:11,402
she's probably
the most clever woman
who ever drew a breath.

174
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:14,372
Just this morning I got
a nice little lecture on poe.

175
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:15,406
Poe?

176
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:17,375
As in Edgar Allan?

177
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:20,278
Oh, god, is there another?

178
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,718
Do you read poe?

179
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,586
Of course not.

180
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:31,689
You don't read Shakespeare,
so why would you read

181
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:35,693
one of our country's greatest
and most influential authors?

182
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,562
Well, when I was a kid

183
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:40,264
I always liked
the Vincent price movies...

184
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:42,400
What-- what's the point?

185
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:47,038
Poe once wrote an essay called
"the philosophy of composition."

186
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,775
In it he develops
his theories about proper art

187
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:55,113
being indifferent to moral
and political considerations,

188
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:58,683
that real art
was about its own dynamic
inner relationships

189
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:02,754
able to stand
on style alone.

190
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:05,056
You should read it.

191
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,126
I guess I have
to ask this again.

192
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:10,161
What's the point?

193
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:12,063
The point,
Dr. galen, is that,

194
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:17,468
in addition to being
a medical doctor,
i am an artist.

195
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,314
Frankie, baby,
good to see you.

196
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:05,249
Hey, listen.
We've got a problem.

197
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,652
It doesn't involve
Mr. Benny Hong Lee.

198
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:09,554
And I really hate
to say this, Frankie,

199
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:11,823
'cause I like you,
but you made some enemies.

200
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:13,758
Some bad ones.

201
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,760
Now, I did
a little renegotiating,

202
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,595
and I got a better deal.

203
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:20,631
I'm now satisfied
that the conditions

204
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,700
are correct
and in place.

205
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,546
Frankie, you should take
it easy on yourself.

206
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:37,381
Do what I tell ya.

207
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,949
Ugh.

208
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,768
The fuck?

209
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,825
Uhh!

210
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:15,039
No!

211
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,408
No!

212
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,377
No!

213
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:55,046
Hey!

214
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:58,482
Who the shit are you?

215
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:03,754
You're some kind of
laid-up hooker, right?

216
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:07,892
You on dope?

217
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:12,697
Somebody work you over?

218
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:15,466
I kinda like
that look of yours.

219
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:17,435
Get out.

220
00:22:17,437 --> 00:22:20,571
I got a right being
in this room, okay?

221
00:22:20,573 --> 00:22:23,841
I own and operate
this joint.

222
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:25,910
And your screamin'...

223
00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:28,713
Somebody wandering
around in here,

224
00:22:28,715 --> 00:22:32,116
I thought maybe
there might be trouble.

225
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:34,085
Where'd you
come from, huh?

226
00:22:34,087 --> 00:22:37,955
The guys registered
in this room didn't
tell me nothin'.

227
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:42,660
You know, you might wanna be
takin' it six or so blocks

228
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:46,497
out to here, where all
the weirdos hang out?

229
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:49,800
Probably pull in
a lot more business
down there.

230
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:54,071
Just bein' friendly.

231
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:59,810
You keep it down
in here, hey, babe?

232
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,565
<i> Hello, frank.</i>

233
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:03,033
<i> You can call me</i>
<i> the doctor.</i>

234
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:06,170
<i> I'm the one</i>
<i> who operated on you.</i>

235
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:08,539
And the reason
why is simple.

236
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:09,907
A year and a half ago,

237
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:12,176
you killed a man
very close to me.

238
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:14,979
<i> In the handbag I've left</i>
<i> a photograph of him</i>

239
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:19,783
<i> as a small reminder</i>
<i> of the terrible thing you did.</i>

240
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:21,886
<i> You should think positive,</i>

241
00:25:21,888 --> 00:25:24,555
<i> maybe even thank me.</i>

242
00:25:24,557 --> 00:25:26,090
<i> You have a new life.</i>

243
00:25:26,092 --> 00:25:27,992
<i> You get to start over.</i>

244
00:25:27,994 --> 00:25:31,128
<i> And this time</i>
<i> you're a woman.</i>

245
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,830
In many ways,
it's often said,

246
00:25:32,832 --> 00:25:35,232
the most splendid
of god's creatures.

247
00:25:35,234 --> 00:25:38,235
<i> I have liberated you</i>
<i> from the macho prison</i>

248
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:39,870
<i> you've been living in.</i>

249
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,772
<i> I'm an excellent surgeon,</i>

250
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:44,141
<i>and I'm quite proud of the work</i>
<i> I've done on you.</i>

251
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:47,177
<i> Your face and body have been</i>
<i> carefully sculpted,</i>

252
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:50,548
<i> with no visible scars</i>
<i> to the casual observer.</i>

253
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:54,718
<i> People pay small fortunes</i>
<i> for work that's less good</i>

254
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,321
<i> than what's been done</i>
<i> on you.</i>

255
00:25:57,323 --> 00:26:00,024
But I'm afraid
you'll have to sustain

256
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:02,893
your new femininity
with hormones.

257
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:06,664
<i> You'll find everything you</i>
<i> need in the package I've sent.</i>

258
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:09,033
<i> You should begin with</i>
<i> a premarin immediately,</i>

259
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:11,001
<i> at first, two per day.</i>

260
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:13,737
<i> After one week,</i>
<i> add the prevera.</i>

261
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:15,906
<i> Two per day.</i>

262
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:18,876
<i> I've also left you some</i>
<i> feminine clothing</i>

263
00:26:18,878 --> 00:26:23,247
<i> and $100 for sundries</i>
<i> while you convalesce.</i>

264
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:25,649
<i> I understand your current</i>
<i> accommodations</i>

265
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:27,318
<i> are less than ideal.</i>

266
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,353
<i> Several of my employees</i>
<i> paid the rent.</i>

267
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:33,023
<i> Your room is taken care of</i>
<i> for the next two weeks.</i>

268
00:26:33,025 --> 00:26:36,160
<i> We left word to leave</i>
<i> you undisturbed.</i>

269
00:26:36,162 --> 00:26:40,197
<i> My generosity allows you</i>
<i>to recuperate at your own pace.</i>

270
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,135
<i> A quote from Hamlet that you</i>
<i> might find inspirational:</i>

271
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:47,705
<i> "God has given you</i>
<i> one face,</i>

272
00:26:47,707 --> 00:26:50,774
<i> and you make</i>
<i> yourselves another."</i>

273
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,710
Good luck, frank.

274
00:26:52,712 --> 00:26:55,279
You've been a very bad man.

275
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:58,382
This is your opportunity
for redemption.

276
00:29:05,343 --> 00:29:08,946
Oh, no, honey, you
picked the wrong guy
to try to rip off.

277
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:13,951
That look of yours,
i kinda like.

278
00:29:13,953 --> 00:29:16,286
I just gotta check out
what you got down there.

279
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:56,026
Come on, hustle.

280
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:58,889
Hey! You remember me?

281
00:30:58,891 --> 00:31:01,458
Look, room 3-- room 308.

282
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,026
I need my keys, now.

283
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,667
fuck!

284
00:31:57,348 --> 00:31:58,649
Oh, oh...

285
00:31:58,651 --> 00:32:01,151
Yeah.

286
00:32:01,153 --> 00:32:04,121
All right.

287
00:32:04,123 --> 00:32:05,589
All right.

288
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,194
Okay.

289
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:33,617
Your medical setup...

290
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,452
The equipment, the nurses,

291
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,955
your private bodyguards...

292
00:32:37,957 --> 00:32:39,656
The costs must have
been enormous.

293
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:41,091
Say it.

294
00:32:41,093 --> 00:32:44,728
"How did I get
so goddamn rich?"

295
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,163
Okay.

296
00:32:46,165 --> 00:32:48,598
How did you get
so goddamn rich?

297
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,669
My father did well enough
to send me to good schools.

298
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:55,739
When he died, I received
a reasonable inheritance

299
00:32:55,741 --> 00:33:00,310
which, unlike my brother,
i prudently invested.

300
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,179
Then I went to work.

301
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:04,114
I was very good
at my profession,

302
00:33:04,116 --> 00:33:07,284
and my practice turned out
to be quite lucrative.

303
00:33:07,286 --> 00:33:10,220
If you're a plastic surgeon,
the sky is the limit.

304
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:14,091
Then there were issues
with your peers
at mother of mercy?

305
00:33:14,093 --> 00:33:16,326
I had enemies.

306
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:20,497
Political enemies within
the medical community.

307
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,333
My manner has always
caused me problems

308
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:27,604
with those less
equipped to keep up.

309
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:31,208
I was a better surgeon
than any of them.

310
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,110
They hated that.

311
00:33:33,112 --> 00:33:35,078
And I was a woman.

312
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,115
That made it worse.

313
00:33:38,117 --> 00:33:40,517
All right, yes.

314
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:44,721
When I lost my medical license
i set up an illegal clinic.

315
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:50,327
Before I often did
plastic surgery for idiots

316
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:54,031
who wanted a smaller nose,
larger breasts,

317
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:55,565
sometimes a larger penis--

318
00:33:55,567 --> 00:34:00,170
more to the point,
you then became interested in...

319
00:34:01,673 --> 00:34:04,741
Gender change
operations, yes.

320
00:34:04,743 --> 00:34:07,411
After I could no longer
officially practice,

321
00:34:07,413 --> 00:34:11,314
I discovered
a huge black market
for that kind of surgery.

322
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:14,084
Most people who want it
don't want to go through

323
00:34:14,086 --> 00:34:17,120
the endless waiting period,
and, in addition,

324
00:34:17,122 --> 00:34:20,357
many times they can't afford
the enormous costs.

325
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:22,092
And you took advantage.

326
00:34:22,094 --> 00:34:24,127
I was doing
beneficial things,

327
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:25,462
making people happy,

328
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:29,199
giving them the medical
attention they wanted.

329
00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:31,668
And it had the added
benefit of financing

330
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:33,837
my independent research.

331
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:38,542
In school I was always
at the top of my class.

332
00:34:38,544 --> 00:34:42,846
At the hospital I was always
the best surgeon on staff.

333
00:34:42,848 --> 00:34:46,516
I was always the one
who figured out
a new technique,

334
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:49,419
a better way
of getting things done.

335
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:55,592
But all it ever got me
was envy, jealousy,

336
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:58,428
and now disgrace.

337
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:02,699
So I became a rogue.

338
00:35:02,701 --> 00:35:05,869
A rogue
on the medical frontier.

339
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:09,639
And it's lonely
out there, Ralph.

340
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:11,308
Quite lonely.

341
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,388
Yeah?

342
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,657
Hi, is-- is Johnnie there?

343
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:30,360
Yeah, this is Johnnie.

344
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:32,395
It's me, frank.

345
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:34,898
Frank.

346
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,399
<i> Yeah.</i>

347
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:38,902
Midnight coffee date frank.

348
00:35:38,904 --> 00:35:41,771
<i> Hey, you remember me, huh?</i>

349
00:35:41,773 --> 00:35:43,440
Yeah, I remember.

350
00:35:43,442 --> 00:35:48,245
Um... you wanna meet
for a coffee?

351
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,817
Sure.

352
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:54,851
Tonight?

353
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:56,887
<i> Yeah.</i>

354
00:35:56,889 --> 00:35:59,389
How about we meet
at that place near you?

355
00:35:59,391 --> 00:36:01,892
<i> Same place as before.</i>

356
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:07,531
Hey, listen.

357
00:36:07,533 --> 00:36:12,269
I, uh...
I don't look the same.

358
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:15,705
I shaved,
and some other stuff. I, um...

359
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:17,641
Hey, I gotta get
back to work.

360
00:36:17,643 --> 00:36:20,510
I'm working a double,
so I'll meet you on my break.

361
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:22,679
<i> Say, ten o' clock?</i>

362
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:25,382
Yeah, I'll-- I'll
see you tonight.

363
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:55,278
Frank?

364
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:58,815
Yeah, it's me.

365
00:36:58,817 --> 00:37:00,817
I look
a little different, huh?

366
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:02,852
You are different.

367
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:04,354
A lot different.

368
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:08,792
I... I don't know
what to say.

369
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:12,229
So you're a nurse.

370
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:14,497
Yeah, I guess I forgot
to mention it.

371
00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:17,367
You had plastic surgery,
huh?

372
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:19,970
Just like some gangster guy
out of an old movie?

373
00:37:19,972 --> 00:37:21,938
You're some kind
of criminal, right?

374
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,673
I had that figured.

375
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,744
I can still tell
it's you, though.

376
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,846
It's okay.
You look all right.

377
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:35,318
I got into some
real bad shit

378
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,953
with some real bad guys.

379
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:40,690
I was hoping I could
stay over at your house

380
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:42,325
for a couple of days.

381
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:44,661
I promise to stay
out of your way.

382
00:37:44,663 --> 00:37:46,496
I'll even pay you
for it.

383
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:48,932
No. I don't want
your money.

384
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:50,934
We're friends.

385
00:37:50,936 --> 00:37:52,836
Fuck buddies.

386
00:37:57,676 --> 00:38:00,677
Yeah, it's
pretty basic here.

387
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:03,947
I'm not a lot
on fixing places up.

388
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:06,850
I don't even got a TV.

389
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:10,553
I like to keep things
to a minimum, you know?

390
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:12,856
I just need a place
to clear my head.

391
00:38:12,858 --> 00:38:14,557
Figure out what
I'm gonna do.

392
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:15,659
This is fine.

393
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:17,027
Stay as long
as you want.

394
00:38:17,029 --> 00:38:19,062
I'll let you know if you
wear out your welcome.

395
00:38:19,064 --> 00:38:20,563
Hey, one thing.

396
00:38:20,565 --> 00:38:24,968
I, um, I started to tell
you that at the diner.

397
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,036
I got problems.

398
00:38:26,038 --> 00:38:28,305
Hey, no pressure.

399
00:38:28,307 --> 00:38:29,773
Suit yourself.

400
00:38:29,775 --> 00:38:31,908
But since it's my place
i keep the bed.

401
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,376
You sleep on the sofa.

402
00:38:33,378 --> 00:38:36,046
I'll get you a blanket
and a sheet.

403
00:38:36,048 --> 00:38:37,881
I keep an extra pillow
in the closet.

404
00:38:37,883 --> 00:38:39,783
It's all clean, so you
don't have to worry

405
00:38:39,785 --> 00:38:42,352
about catching
some disease.

406
00:38:42,354 --> 00:38:45,822
<i> Mi casa es su casa,</i> right?

407
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:50,460
Anyway, I always trust
my instinct,
you know what I mean?

408
00:38:50,462 --> 00:38:54,764
I'm not sure why, but I feel
kinda connected to you.

409
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:57,534
Big boys tell me
I'm a little crazy.

410
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,872
I got that for Halloween
a couple years ago.

411
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:05,342
It's weird, huh?

412
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,621
You-- you thought your life
was in danger?

413
00:39:18,623 --> 00:39:20,957
Clearly there was
that possibility.

414
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:23,493
Criminal organizations
sometimes try to pass

415
00:39:23,495 --> 00:39:24,828
an unpaid debt along

416
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:26,963
to other members
of the victim's family.

417
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:29,666
The men who hired
frank kitchen
to kill my brother

418
00:39:29,668 --> 00:39:32,102
might have turned
him loose on me.

419
00:39:32,104 --> 00:39:34,104
You hired bodyguards.

420
00:39:34,106 --> 00:39:36,573
I did.
Three of them.

421
00:39:36,575 --> 00:39:39,442
I even insisted
on a dress code.

422
00:39:39,444 --> 00:39:41,611
I'm sorry, a dress code?

423
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:44,914
Yeah. Dark suit,
white shirt and tie.

424
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:49,018
<i> I, of course, had to buy</i>
<i> their wardrobe for them.</i>

425
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,921
They were all but one
ex-policemen.

426
00:39:51,923 --> 00:39:53,590
But in the end,

427
00:39:53,592 --> 00:39:57,427
all three of them
turned out to be worthless.

428
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:02,499
Question: If you're rich,

429
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:04,934
and you loved
your brother so much

430
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:07,570
and he's in all this trouble
with all the wrong people,

431
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:10,006
why didn't you just
give him the money he owed?

432
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:12,041
I did. All of it.

433
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:13,710
And he went out
and bought paintings

434
00:40:13,712 --> 00:40:15,712
and drugs
and pinball machines.

435
00:40:15,714 --> 00:40:19,182
Gambled and partied,
squandered every penny.

436
00:40:19,184 --> 00:40:22,018
Then he came back,
said he was sorry,

437
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,454
and asked me
for more money.

438
00:40:24,456 --> 00:40:27,690
As a matter of principle,
i said no.

439
00:40:27,692 --> 00:40:29,692
It was a mistake.

440
00:40:29,694 --> 00:40:32,595
So you feel guilty
about his death?

441
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:37,434
No. Not for a moment.

442
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:40,837
My brother was a fool,
but he was also a unique,

443
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:44,541
eccentric, and talented man.

444
00:40:44,543 --> 00:40:46,976
He just never seemed
to find his place

445
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:49,179
in the grand scheme
of things.

446
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:54,984
How's it going?

447
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:56,920
Uh, she's gotten
very chatty.

448
00:40:56,922 --> 00:40:59,055
But evasive.

449
00:40:59,057 --> 00:41:01,558
Keeps a lot of it
theoretical.

450
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,226
Right from the get-go,
as soon as she got here

451
00:41:03,228 --> 00:41:06,129
she was the most anti-social
piss-ant on campus.

452
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:07,964
No communication, no jokes.

453
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:11,134
Just death stares
and a wall of ice.

454
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:14,737
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's give it up
for Dr. Rachel Jane.

455
00:41:14,739 --> 00:41:18,141
Phi beta kappa.
Three degrees with honors.

456
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:22,145
Never married,
no children, thank god.

457
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:30,520
Let's see what happens tomorrow
if I turn the heat up a little.

458
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:36,025
Hello, doctor.

459
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:38,027
How are we feeling
this morning?

460
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:39,829
You can release
the arms, Hector.

461
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:40,997
Thank you.

462
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:44,267
If you'd indulge me
here for a moment,

463
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:46,636
I'd like to go back
and review the facts
of this case

464
00:41:46,638 --> 00:41:50,707
as they pertain
to your criminal
involvement.

465
00:41:50,709 --> 00:41:52,942
You're sounding
very serious, Ralph.

466
00:41:52,944 --> 00:41:55,111
I thought we were
becoming friends.

467
00:41:55,113 --> 00:41:57,614
Your brother,
Sebastian Jane,

468
00:41:57,616 --> 00:42:01,150
the semi-celebrity playboy
socialite art collector,

469
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:03,286
pinball wizard,
occasional art critic,

470
00:42:03,288 --> 00:42:05,188
drug addict, alcoholic,
etc., etc.

471
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:08,892
A little respect.
He had world-famous collections.

472
00:42:08,894 --> 00:42:11,861
It is believed that
Sebastian Jane was murdered

473
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:15,632
by certain mob interests
to whom he owed money,

474
00:42:15,634 --> 00:42:17,133
a lot of money,

475
00:42:17,135 --> 00:42:19,102
and then,
according to the police,

476
00:42:19,104 --> 00:42:21,638
there were several rumors
in the criminal world

477
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,907
that you had hired
local racketeers

478
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:28,144
to find out who the person was
that killed your brother.

479
00:42:28,146 --> 00:42:30,613
This "killer,"
which, according to you

480
00:42:30,615 --> 00:42:33,016
is a professional hitman
named frank kitchen--

481
00:42:33,018 --> 00:42:34,150
now this is
getting tedious.

482
00:42:34,152 --> 00:42:35,785
Help me, doctor.

483
00:42:35,787 --> 00:42:37,854
We have a lot
of dead bodies,

484
00:42:37,856 --> 00:42:40,657
but none of them are
traceable to your
frank kitchen.

485
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:44,193
Are you really saying
that because my brother
wasn't a very nice person,

486
00:42:44,195 --> 00:42:48,197
that he deserves
to be brutally murdered
by this street trash?

487
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:50,867
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, you're
creating a straw man.

488
00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:53,069
That is not
what I'm saying,
and you know it.

489
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:54,771
What are you
saying, Ralph?

490
00:42:54,773 --> 00:42:57,040
You're becoming
such a tiresome bore

491
00:42:57,042 --> 00:42:58,875
and such a confused person

492
00:42:58,877 --> 00:43:01,010
that I find it difficult
to follow your thoughts.

493
00:43:01,012 --> 00:43:05,081
I'm asking you if all this
wasn't really some sort

494
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,951
of classical
psychological transference

495
00:43:07,953 --> 00:43:10,987
of your own personal
inadequacies.

496
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:14,991
This man you keep talking
about, this frank kitchen,

497
00:43:14,993 --> 00:43:17,226
doesn't even
seem to exist.

498
00:43:17,228 --> 00:43:18,595
That again?

499
00:43:18,597 --> 00:43:20,797
-I mean, really?
-Yes, that again.

500
00:43:20,799 --> 00:43:25,234
Doctor, I had the FBI
do a run on the name.

501
00:43:25,236 --> 00:43:27,270
Nothing.
No frank kitchen,

502
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:29,772
no professional hitman
or anything even close.

503
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:31,874
No criminal record,
no fingerprints,

504
00:43:31,876 --> 00:43:34,210
no record
in the armed services,

505
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:36,379
no driver's license,
no taxes paid.

506
00:43:36,381 --> 00:43:38,615
No passports, nothing.

507
00:43:42,686 --> 00:43:44,854
Dr. Jane.

508
00:43:44,856 --> 00:43:50,727
Was all this because you had
a nonexistent sex life?

509
00:43:50,729 --> 00:43:55,064
You were a kind
of medical wallflower.

510
00:43:55,066 --> 00:43:58,635
The female equivalent of
some guy who was impotent.

511
00:43:58,637 --> 00:43:59,702
Couldn't get it up.

512
00:43:59,704 --> 00:44:02,138
This is just silly.

513
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:05,808
I've had sex when I wanted
and with whom I wanted

514
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,877
for my entire adult life.

515
00:44:07,879 --> 00:44:11,748
And did you have sex with
your surgical assistant,
Albert Becker?

516
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:14,917
Yes, quite often.
Any time I wanted.

517
00:44:14,919 --> 00:44:17,353
Oh. It was part
of his job?

518
00:44:17,355 --> 00:44:19,255
He seemed to enjoy it.

519
00:44:19,257 --> 00:44:22,425
I've never concerned myself
with my partner's pleasure.

520
00:44:22,427 --> 00:44:25,128
Just knock one off
and back to your real work.

521
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:26,262
Yeah, exactly.

522
00:44:26,264 --> 00:44:28,831
I see. To summarize,
in addition

523
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:31,334
to your academic
and medical achievements,

524
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:35,972
your personal sex life
has been quite wonderful.

525
00:44:35,974 --> 00:44:38,107
I guess I'll just have
to take your word for it.

526
00:44:38,109 --> 00:44:40,009
Yes, you'll just have
to take my word for it.

527
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:42,111
Admit it. Your lover,
Albert Becker,

528
00:44:42,113 --> 00:44:44,247
turned out to be
a murderous lunatic,

529
00:44:44,249 --> 00:44:46,182
and there is
no frank kitchen--

530
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:48,084
I'm sick
of this bullshit!

531
00:44:48,086 --> 00:44:51,154
Don't you dare play
psychiatrist with me,
goddamn it!

532
00:44:51,156 --> 00:44:54,824
There is a frank kitchen!
There is a frank kitchen!

533
00:44:54,826 --> 00:44:58,127
Do you think that you're
some fucking detective?!

534
00:44:58,129 --> 00:45:01,831
You're nothing
more than a cheap,
second-rate bureaucrat!

535
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:13,776
<i> My name's</i>
<i> frank kitchen.</i>

536
00:45:13,778 --> 00:45:15,278

537
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,780
<i> but it's the one</i>
<i> I use for my work.</i>

538
00:45:17,782 --> 00:45:20,049

<i> of what happened to me.</i>

539
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:21,451
<i> I don't know.</i>

540
00:45:21,453 --> 00:45:26,122
Consider it a therapy session
for someone that, uh,

541
00:45:26,124 --> 00:45:28,157
never liked talking much.

542
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:32,028
When I'm done
telling this story,

543
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:34,831
I'm gonna send it out
to my lawyer in Miami

544
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:36,999
and he's gonna
put it on ice,

545
00:45:37,001 --> 00:45:39,769
<i> in case after I'm dead</i>

<i> to frank kitchen.</i>

547
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:52,248

548
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,883

549
00:45:53,885 --> 00:45:56,886
<i> Why the hell</i>
<i> would they be pissed?</i>

550
00:45:56,888 --> 00:45:58,821
<i> And if they were pissed,</i>

551
00:45:58,823 --> 00:46:03,092
<i> why not just give me a push</i>
<i> instead of this butcher job?</i>

552
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:05,228
<i> And who was this doctor?</i>

553
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:08,164
<i> And how was honest John</i>
<i> connected to her?</i>

554
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,969
I had to get back
to the street.

555
00:46:12,971 --> 00:46:15,238
I had to get
to honest John.

556
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,007
But I wasn't ready
to go straight to him.

557
00:46:18,009 --> 00:46:21,110
I had to make sure I could
still make my old moves.

558
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:26,182
<i> It's hard to go back</i>
<i> to being frank kitchen</i>

559
00:46:26,184 --> 00:46:28,050
<i> when you look like a chick.</i>

560
00:46:28,052 --> 00:46:30,486
<i> I had to tape</i>
<i> my swollen tits.</i>

561
00:46:30,488 --> 00:46:32,488
<i> I had to sit down</i>
<i> to take a piss.</i>

00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:35,958
<i> And the goddamn hormones</i>
<i> were making me soft.</i>

563
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,928
If there was anything left
of frank kitchen...

564
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:42,899
It was his point-blank aim,

565
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:46,202
and I couldn't wait
to use it.

566
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:14,123
<i> First guy on the list:</i>
<i> Earl Hawkins.</i>

567
00:48:14,125 --> 00:48:17,059
<i> Long time</i>
<i> on honest John's payroll.</i>

568
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:20,329
<i> Earl runs the pimps</i>
<i> that run the hookers.</i>

<i> Emece trece guys.</i>

571

<i> They did a lot of heavy</i>

<i> over in the east bay.</i>

<i> Joe caddigan.</i>

574

<i> Miami said Joe was</i>
<i> honest John's main dope guy.</i>

575
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:09,278
<i> He imported smack,</i>
<i> and a lot of it.</i>

576
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,280
<i> Nobody was gonna miss him.</i>

577
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:13,082
Hey, Joe.

578
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:34,637
<i> Vladimir gorsky.</i>

579
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:38,207
<i> This guy was some kind</i>
<i> of Russian mafia reject.</i>

580
00:49:38,209 --> 00:49:39,742
<i> He was in charge</i>
<i> of collections</i>

581
00:49:39,744 --> 00:49:41,344
<i> on short-term loans</i>

582
00:49:41,346 --> 00:49:44,280

<i> at sky-high rates.</i>

583
00:49:44,282 --> 00:49:48,617
<i> Gorski's sideline</i>
<i> was raising dogs for fights.</i>

584

<i> But if a dog don't win,</i>

585

<i> then he and his trainer</i>
<i> kill the dogs.</i>

586
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,195
You're the one who called
about buying a dog.

587
00:49:59,197 --> 00:50:01,130
Yeah, that's me.

588
00:50:01,132 --> 00:50:02,999
Where did you get
my number?

589
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:05,201
I got it
from honest John's boys.

590
00:50:05,203 --> 00:50:06,335
Hmm.

591
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:09,638
What's his name?

592
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,475
We call him poncho.

593
00:50:12,477 --> 00:50:14,443
It'll cost you $2,000.

594
00:50:14,445 --> 00:50:16,278
He's in very good shape.

595
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,646
He's ready to fight.

596
00:50:17,648 --> 00:50:19,548
You show Vladimir
money, huh?

597
00:50:25,156 --> 00:50:29,792
A dog is the only thing
i ever trusted.

598
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:34,563
A dog doesn't care
if you're rich or poor,

599
00:50:34,565 --> 00:50:37,400
if you're famous
or some bum.

600
00:50:37,402 --> 00:50:40,803
Only thing a dog wants
is to be your buddy.

601

<i> It's funny how things</i>
<i> work out.</i>

602
00:50:59,257 --> 00:51:04,460
<i> It wasn't part of my plan,</i>
<i> but now I had a dog.</i>

603
00:51:04,462 --> 00:51:08,097
<i> Poncho had some scars</i>
<i>from where they made him fight,</i>

604
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:10,666
<i> but he was really</i>
<i> just a sweet guy.</i>

605
00:51:10,668 --> 00:51:13,669
<i> Me and poncho were buddies</i>
<i> in no time.</i>

606
00:51:13,671 --> 00:51:16,772
<i> It was the most domestic</i>
<i> I've ever been in my life,</i>

<i> it was okay.</i>

Oh, hey.
How's it going?

609
00:51:24,682 --> 00:51:26,749
You having a good day?

610
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:29,752
Mine was okay,
despite the head
fucking nurse in c ward

611
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:31,587
who's got it in for me.

612
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:34,390

Oh, there's this one patient,
this old guy, Jerry.

614
00:51:38,296 --> 00:51:40,229
Every time I try
and change his iv

615
00:51:40,231 --> 00:51:42,231
he always grabs my ass.

616
00:51:42,233 --> 00:51:46,202
I don't mind.
He's sweet and he's
on his way out, so...

617
00:51:46,204 --> 00:51:48,504
Oh, here s a blast
of good news.

618
00:51:48,506 --> 00:51:51,207
No more double shifts,

hang out more.

620

You wanna take off
your clothes?

622
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:21,504
Okay.

623
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:27,376
I mean, I'll--
I'll do what I can.

624
00:52:27,378 --> 00:52:29,778
You'll do fine.

625
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:07,783

<i> hello to old friends.</i>

628
00:53:17,595 --> 00:53:21,197
<i> You knock off a guy who you</i>
<i> think is gonna be all alone,</i>

629
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:23,532
<i> you use the silencer.</i>

630
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:26,535
<i> You wanna make</i>
<i> as little noise as possible.</i>

631
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:29,638
<i> But if you figure you're gonna</i>
<i> take on resistance</i>

632
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,241
<i> then leave</i>
<i> the silencer at home.</i>

633
00:53:32,243 --> 00:53:34,343
<i> You wanna let</i>
<i> the sound of the .45</i>

634
00:53:34,345 --> 00:53:36,512
<i> scare the shit</i>
<i> out of them.</i>

635
00:53:36,514 --> 00:53:38,747
<i> Throws off their aim.</i>

636
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:08,877
How you been?

637
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:33,736
Hello, doctor.

638
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:40,276
Hello, Ralph.

639
00:54:40,278 --> 00:54:42,745
Good of you to come.

640
00:54:42,747 --> 00:54:44,480
I know you'll doubt this,

641
00:54:44,482 --> 00:54:46,949
but I actually miss
our little sessions together.

642
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:48,550
You asked to see me.

643
00:54:48,552 --> 00:54:50,753
I did, but first
I'd like to apologize

644
00:54:50,755 --> 00:54:53,355
for my fit of temper
at our last meeting.

645
00:54:53,357 --> 00:54:56,525
I momentarily lost
my composure.

646
00:54:56,527 --> 00:54:59,461
Apology accepted.

647
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:03,766
I want to make
a legal deposition

648
00:55:03,768 --> 00:55:06,302
to be filed
with the district
attorney's office.

649
00:55:06,304 --> 00:55:08,470
I'd like to confess.

650
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:11,807
And for which crimes
you've committed

651
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:13,676
are you willing
to make these confessions?

652
00:55:13,678 --> 00:55:15,377
All of them, Ralph.

653
00:55:15,379 --> 00:55:19,748
Every single one
that I'm responsible for.

654
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:22,851
I'm afraid I've been
a very naughty lady.

655
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:27,323
Would you like to tell me
what you hope to accomplish

656
00:55:27,325 --> 00:55:29,625
-with this deposition?
-Certainly.

657
00:55:29,627 --> 00:55:32,361
The authorities
will clearly see

658
00:55:32,363 --> 00:55:35,564
that I've made great progress
here at the hospital,

659
00:55:35,566 --> 00:55:38,100
but most important,

660
00:55:38,102 --> 00:55:41,470
when I confess it will
cleanse my soul.

661
00:55:41,472 --> 00:55:43,839
I will be born again.

662
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:50,045
-Home phone?
-None.

663
00:55:50,047 --> 00:55:52,448
Insurance carrier?

664
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:55,651
I don't have one,
but I can pay cash.

665
00:55:55,653 --> 00:55:57,353
Referring physician?

666
00:55:57,355 --> 00:56:01,090
I found out about
this place from a friend.

667
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:05,661
And you're here for
a diagnostic consultation?

668
00:56:05,663 --> 00:56:09,631
Yeah. I need to speak
to a real surgery doctor.

669
00:56:09,633 --> 00:56:12,935
You know, a guy who is--
does major surgery.

670
00:56:16,673 --> 00:56:19,508
Are you in any pain?

671
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:22,511
It's all still
a bit sore.

672
00:56:22,513 --> 00:56:26,415
I, uh, I think I popped
a couple of stitches.

673
00:56:26,417 --> 00:56:29,151
Who was your surgeon?

674
00:56:29,153 --> 00:56:32,821
I can't remember
right now.

675
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:38,994
Well, he seems to have
done a fine job,

676
00:56:38,996 --> 00:56:41,430
so why aren't you talking
to him about this?

677
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:46,668
Well, I can't afford
the plane fare, for one.

678
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:49,438
Where? Colorado?
The clinic there in Denver?

679
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,140
They do wonderful work.

680
00:56:51,142 --> 00:56:53,108
Yeah, that's right.

681
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:57,012
The transgender programs
that I'm aware of

682
00:56:57,014 --> 00:57:00,015
all have very thorough
screening processes.

683
00:57:00,017 --> 00:57:02,151
How long have you been
living as a transsexual?

684
00:57:02,153 --> 00:57:04,686
For a few months.

685
00:57:04,688 --> 00:57:08,657
Ordinarily, there's
a requirement of functioning

686
00:57:08,659 --> 00:57:10,859
for at least a year
in the transgender role

687
00:57:10,861 --> 00:57:13,429
before an actual surgery
is performed.

688
00:57:13,431 --> 00:57:15,731
Did they not
insist upon that?

689
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,835
Yeah, well, that's--
that's the thing.

690
00:57:19,837 --> 00:57:25,674
Um... I um... I thought
i wanted it, so I...

691
00:57:25,676 --> 00:57:29,044
You know, I told them what
i knew they wanted to hear.

692
00:57:29,046 --> 00:57:31,213
You should never let
embarrassment prevent you

693
00:57:31,215 --> 00:57:34,149
from taking the best possible
care you can of your body.

694
00:57:34,151 --> 00:57:36,552
It's your obligation
to yourself.

695
00:57:36,554 --> 00:57:38,454
Now, I'd like you to call
a counselor that I know.

696
00:57:38,456 --> 00:57:40,055
She's part of
a very good therapy group.

697
00:57:40,057 --> 00:57:41,857
You can use my name
as a referral.

698
00:57:41,859 --> 00:57:47,095
I don't want a counselor.
I don't need group therapy.

699
00:57:47,097 --> 00:57:50,599
Can the operation
be reversed?

700
00:57:50,601 --> 00:57:55,571
And if that's not
possible then...

701
00:57:55,573 --> 00:57:59,875
Can I get off
with whatever this is?

702
00:57:59,877 --> 00:58:02,644
It usually takes
six months to a year

703
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:05,514
to develop
sensation again.

704
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:10,552
Look, I just want to know
if I can go back to being a guy.

705
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:14,189
Medically, other than
the breast implants,

706
00:58:14,191 --> 00:58:16,658
it's too soon to even
consider another procedure.

707
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,861
I'd be irresponsible
in advising you otherwise,

708
00:58:18,863 --> 00:58:21,964
and no reputable physician
will operate on you again

709
00:58:21,966 --> 00:58:26,835
without at least six months
of intensive therapy.

710
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:30,172
Can I go back
to being a guy?

711
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:35,244
Again, the implants,
that's not a problem.

712
00:58:35,246 --> 00:58:37,813
But beyond that,
to the best of my knowledge,

713
00:58:37,815 --> 00:58:39,982
there is no procedure that
will completely restore you

714
00:58:39,984 --> 00:58:41,683
back to your former self.

715
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:43,852
Cosmetically, yes,
something can be done.

716
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:46,121
But it won't
be functional.

717
00:58:46,123 --> 00:58:48,123
What it sounds like
you're asking for

718
00:58:48,125 --> 00:58:51,059
is currently
medically impossible.

719
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:58,934
<i> So that was it.</i>

720
00:58:58,936 --> 00:59:01,770
<i> This was the way</i>
<i> it was gonna be.</i>

721
00:59:01,772 --> 00:59:05,274
<i> I was gonna be a chick</i>
<i> except for in my head,</i>

722
00:59:05,276 --> 00:59:07,910
<i> so get used to it.</i>

723
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,254
Two people.

724
00:59:19,256 --> 00:59:23,091
One's a beauty and one's
an i-don't-know what.

725
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:28,830
I'm still trying to figure
you out, and I don't get it.

726
00:59:28,832 --> 00:59:34,169
But, you know, look
at the bright side.

727
00:59:34,171 --> 00:59:36,705
The cops are never gonna
come looking for you
being a guy,

728
00:59:36,707 --> 00:59:39,141
so maybe being a girl's
the best way to stay
out of prison.

729
00:59:40,877 --> 00:59:43,745
I've been
thinking about this.

730
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:45,113
You could
change your name.

731
00:59:45,115 --> 00:59:46,882
Get a fake passport, papers,

732
00:59:46,884 --> 00:59:49,651
go to Mexico
or Costa Rica or Brazil,

733
00:59:49,653 --> 00:59:52,254
some place where people
hide out, you know?

734
00:59:52,256 --> 00:59:54,156
Nobody would find you.

735
00:59:54,158 --> 00:59:57,326
I'm sure you know somebody
who can get you a fake ID.

736
01:00:00,063 --> 01:00:02,598
What about you?

737
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,366
You want me
to go with you?

738
01:00:04,368 --> 01:00:07,736
No.

739
01:00:07,738 --> 01:00:09,738
Haven't I made
enough trouble for you?

740
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:19,081
<i> All right, let's proceed.</i>

741
01:00:19,083 --> 01:00:20,682
We'll begin
with the formalities.

742
01:00:20,684 --> 01:00:23,685
It's February 3rd,
3:00 in the afternoon.

743
01:00:23,687 --> 01:00:25,153
I'm Paul wincott,

744
01:00:25,155 --> 01:00:28,090
deputy district attorney
for Alameda county, California.

745
01:00:28,092 --> 01:00:30,626
This hearing will be visually
recorded as well as transcribed

746
01:00:30,628 --> 01:00:33,295
by a duly appointed stenographer
for the supreme court

747
01:00:33,297 --> 01:00:35,364
of the state of California
under the jurisdiction

748
01:00:35,366 --> 01:00:38,667
of the honorable
judge Thomas vancleeve.

749
01:00:38,669 --> 01:00:40,168
Doctor, now it's
my understanding

750
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:42,004
that you'd like to make
an opening statement

751
01:00:42,006 --> 01:00:43,772
before we proceed with
a series of questions

752
01:00:43,774 --> 01:00:45,841
pertaining to your case.

753
01:00:45,843 --> 01:00:47,709
This is a confession.

754
01:00:47,711 --> 01:00:49,678
It has very little to do
with the dead bodies

755
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,380
you found at my clinic.

756
01:00:51,382 --> 01:00:53,882
They were simply
collateral damage.

757
01:00:53,884 --> 01:00:56,251
My confession deals
with the professional killer

758
01:00:56,253 --> 01:00:59,788
frank kitchen, or whatever
his real name is.

759
01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:02,124
Contrary to my oath
as a physician

760
01:01:02,126 --> 01:01:04,926
and all civilized
medical standards,

761
01:01:04,928 --> 01:01:08,430
I performed unwanted
and unnecessary radical surgery

762
01:01:08,432 --> 01:01:11,967
on Mr. kitchen, whom I admit
was a completely unknowing

763
01:01:11,969 --> 01:01:14,002
and unwilling patient.

764
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:17,272
I did it partially
for deeply personal reasons.

765
01:01:17,274 --> 01:01:20,042
He had murdered someone
very close to me,

766
01:01:20,044 --> 01:01:23,745
and in return,
my first instinct was basic.

767
01:01:23,747 --> 01:01:27,949
I wanted
to cause frank kitchen
enormous psychic pain.

768
01:01:29,786 --> 01:01:31,787
I want you
to understand this,

769
01:01:31,789 --> 01:01:34,056
and the record
will bear me out.

770
01:01:34,058 --> 01:01:36,458
I'm hugely sympathetic
to those who want

771
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:40,062
and choose to participate
in gender reassignment,

772
01:01:40,064 --> 01:01:43,298
but normally that would
never include frank kitchen.

773
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:46,301
He was by all accounts
the type of man who reveled

774
01:01:46,303 --> 01:01:49,971
in murderous activities,
as well as his masculinity.

775
01:01:49,973 --> 01:01:51,306
But, as time went by,

776
01:01:51,308 --> 01:01:53,809
the more I thought
about the situation,

777
01:01:53,811 --> 01:01:56,378
I changed my mind
about the man.

778
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:59,848
He was an abandoned child who
had become a ward of the state,

779
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:03,285
condemned to live
on the streets at an early age.

780
01:02:03,287 --> 01:02:07,456
I have the traditional
romantic nostalgia for the idea

781
01:02:07,458 --> 01:02:10,859
that everyone should
have a second chance,

782
01:02:10,861 --> 01:02:12,761
but I'm also a doctor,

783
01:02:12,763 --> 01:02:15,097
a scientist,
in a way an artist.

784
01:02:15,099 --> 01:02:17,165
I decided I wouldn't
and couldn't do

785
01:02:17,167 --> 01:02:19,968
something simply
for revenge,

786
01:02:19,970 --> 01:02:24,473
so I also performed the surgery
partially as an experiment.

787
01:02:24,475 --> 01:02:26,875
I wanted to reinforce
the theory that,

788
01:02:26,877 --> 01:02:28,810
if gender is identity,

789
01:02:28,812 --> 01:02:31,947
then even the most extreme
surgical procedure

790
01:02:31,949 --> 01:02:36,752
will fail to alter the essence,
and this proved to be true.

791
01:02:36,754 --> 01:02:39,888
Frank kitchen is still
very much the man he was

792
01:02:39,890 --> 01:02:44,493
because he believes himself
to be the man he was.

793
01:02:44,495 --> 01:02:50,165
So you see, my experiment
was a success and a failure.

794
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:54,102
My Sincere hope
for his redemption was naive.

795
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:56,404
Frank kitchen went
right back to the gun.

796
01:02:56,406 --> 01:03:00,108
He went right back
to killing.

797
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:03,912
I also want to confess
to the crime of hubris,

798
01:03:03,914 --> 01:03:07,482
to the unforgivable crime
of an overweening estimation

799
01:03:07,484 --> 01:03:09,251
of my own worth.

800
01:03:09,253 --> 01:03:10,852
However, having said that,

801
01:03:10,854 --> 01:03:14,289
I find myself
at a philosophical crossroads.

802
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:17,025
Whereas I'm aware
of my own inadequacy

803
01:03:17,027 --> 01:03:18,927
in the grand scheme
of things,

804
01:03:18,929 --> 01:03:22,831
simultaneously I find myself
the prisoner of lesser minds.

805
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:27,569
I have dared to defy
conventional morality,

806
01:03:27,571 --> 01:03:30,972
but the true individual
has always had to struggle

807
01:03:30,974 --> 01:03:34,309
with being overwhelmed
by the tribe, and no price,

808
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:37,078
even this imprisonment
and indignity,

809
01:03:37,080 --> 01:03:38,947
is too high to pay

810
01:03:38,949 --> 01:03:41,183
for the privilege
of owning yourself.

811
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:46,454
On your terms,
i am sorry for nothing.

812
01:03:46,456 --> 01:03:48,056
Absolutely nothing.

813
01:03:48,058 --> 01:03:50,425
I am proud
of the experimental work

814
01:03:50,427 --> 01:03:54,429
I was doing
for the benefit of every
living human being.

815
01:03:54,431 --> 01:03:56,898
Sometimes harsh methods
have to be used

816
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:58,934
on the road to progress.

817
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:02,904
That is my statement.

818
01:04:02,906 --> 01:04:05,140
I will answer
no questions.

819
01:04:05,142 --> 01:04:07,442
None of you are
worth my time.

820
01:04:07,444 --> 01:04:09,611
Now take me
back to my cell.

821
01:04:20,858 --> 01:04:24,259
<i> It wasn't like</i>
<i> honest John was</i>
<i> a hard guy to find.</i>

822
01:04:24,261 --> 01:04:26,428
<i> He kept a crappy</i>
<i> old back alley office</i>

823
01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:28,563
<i> in this dry goods store.</i>

824
01:04:28,565 --> 01:04:32,534
<i> He even kept regular hours.</i>

825
01:04:32,536 --> 01:04:36,638
<i> He's got bodyguards,</i>
<i> but no security cameras.</i>

826
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,974
<i> Honest John doesn't</i>
<i> want any record</i>

827
01:04:38,976 --> 01:04:40,508
<i> of who comes to see him</i>

828
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:43,311
<i> or who he's been</i>
<i> talking to.</i>

829
01:04:46,649 --> 01:04:49,084
<i> The best thing you can have</i>
<i> going for you</i>

830
01:04:49,086 --> 01:04:50,352
<i> is the element of surprise.</i>

831
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:54,055
<i> So how do you get that back</i>

832
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:57,459
<i> when your target already</i>
<i> knows he's being hunted?</i>

833
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:02,664
<i> 11:00 am, broad daylight.</i>

834
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:04,566
<i> The place where they work.</i>

835
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:06,568
<i> It's where they feel safe.</i>

836
01:05:06,570 --> 01:05:10,472
<i> It's where you get back</i>
<i> the element of surprise.</i>

837
01:05:11,607 --> 01:05:13,275
Hey, this is
a freight elevator--

838
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:44,472
Whoa!

839
01:05:44,474 --> 01:05:47,275
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

840
01:05:51,013 --> 01:05:53,048
Who the fuck are you?

841
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:55,250
Frank kitchen.

842
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:03,558
<i> I stashed Mr. honest John</i>
<i> in the basement,</i>

843
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:06,261
<i> cleaned up the bodies,</i>

844
01:06:06,263 --> 01:06:09,297
<i> and then I had</i>
<i> a few questions for him.</i>

845
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:32,487
I wanna know
what happened.

846
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:34,990
Why'd you
turn me over?

847
01:06:34,992 --> 01:06:38,693
How I got like this.

848
01:06:38,695 --> 01:06:41,696
I want details, John,

849
01:06:41,698 --> 01:06:44,299
and I don't have
a lot of time.

850
01:06:44,301 --> 01:06:46,701
But I brought
this along.

851
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:52,474
You won't need it.

852
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:58,313
The doctor pays me 25 grand,

853
01:06:58,315 --> 01:07:01,149
I bring her people
to operate on.

854
01:07:01,151 --> 01:07:03,151
It's not easy, you know,

855
01:07:03,153 --> 01:07:05,420
finding people like that,

856
01:07:05,422 --> 01:07:07,655
somebody that nobody's gonna
miss when they disappear.

857
01:07:07,657 --> 01:07:09,290
You don't want
the cops coming around

858
01:07:09,292 --> 01:07:11,026
and asking questions, right?

859
01:07:11,028 --> 01:07:13,495
One more time.

860
01:07:13,497 --> 01:07:16,731
Why me?

861
01:07:19,802 --> 01:07:22,170
Tsk.

862
01:07:22,172 --> 01:07:24,739
This is how it came down.

863
01:07:24,741 --> 01:07:28,076
The doctor wanted you.

864
01:07:28,078 --> 01:07:32,047
But to tell you the truth,
i had it in for you, too.

865
01:07:32,049 --> 01:07:35,083
You did a job
in Vegas a year ago.

866
01:07:35,085 --> 01:07:39,220
<i> The guy you pushed</i>
<i> was a cousin of mine.</i>

867
01:07:42,324 --> 01:07:44,392
<i> It was a family thing.</i>

868
01:07:46,496 --> 01:07:49,130
<i> Look, my cousin is</i>
<i> a fuckin' douchebag,</i>

869
01:07:49,132 --> 01:07:50,565
<i> but the family went nuts.</i>

870
01:07:52,335 --> 01:07:54,335
<i> They call me, they think</i>
<i> I'm some kind of big shot.</i>

871
01:07:54,337 --> 01:07:55,770
<i> What am I gonna</i>
<i> do about it?</i>

872
01:07:55,772 --> 01:07:57,772
<i> When am I gonna</i>
<i> do something?</i>

873
01:07:57,774 --> 01:08:00,308
<i> So I ask around.</i>

874
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:04,312
I find out you were
the guy that did the push.

875
01:08:04,314 --> 01:08:08,783
I feel bad,
but what am I gonna do?

876
01:08:08,785 --> 01:08:12,420
Then the doctor calls me
and she tells me what she needs,

877
01:08:12,422 --> 01:08:15,223
so I figure
i can kill two birds.

878
01:08:15,225 --> 01:08:17,592
I hire you, I'm square
with my family,

879
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:19,828
the doctor gets what
she wants, I get what I want.

880
01:08:19,830 --> 01:08:24,532
Too bad you lose,
but everybody else wins.

881
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:27,802
I wanna hear more
about this doctor.

882
01:08:27,804 --> 01:08:30,805
She makes her money
doing cut-rate surgery.

883
01:08:30,807 --> 01:08:33,108
Somebody told me
they pulled her license

884
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:34,576
a couple of years ago.

885
01:08:34,578 --> 01:08:36,144
We're not buddies.

886
01:08:36,146 --> 01:08:38,313
She keeps
her distance.

887
01:08:38,315 --> 01:08:40,181
You wanna know
about the doctor,

888
01:08:40,183 --> 01:08:41,816
you should ask
your girlfriend.

889
01:08:43,352 --> 01:08:45,186
Say that again?

890
01:08:45,188 --> 01:08:48,790
You heard me.

891
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:52,527
What, you think
you just ran into her
in that bar?

892
01:08:54,331 --> 01:08:57,298
What a fuckin' dumb shit.

893
01:08:57,300 --> 01:09:00,368
I thought you
was a smart guy.

894
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:02,904
But I guess the little head
took over the big head.

895
01:09:02,906 --> 01:09:04,706
Happens all the time.

896
01:09:04,708 --> 01:09:07,142
She followed you
from the hotel.

897
01:09:07,144 --> 01:09:08,776
She picks you up,
she gives you a fuck,

898
01:09:08,778 --> 01:09:11,246
she reports
in to the doctor.

899
01:09:11,248 --> 01:09:15,416
That way they can keep
an eye on you down the line.

900
01:09:15,418 --> 01:09:18,319
She's a nurse, right?

901
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:21,890
Nurses work for doctors.

902
01:09:33,936 --> 01:09:37,906
Yeah, you're right.

903
01:10:22,886 --> 01:10:24,419
Have one.

904
01:10:24,421 --> 01:10:26,754
I think I'm gonna take
a shower first.

905
01:10:26,756 --> 01:10:28,656
I've had kind of
a rough day.

906
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:32,260
Come over here.

907
01:10:32,262 --> 01:10:33,728
Sit down.

908
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:35,630
I poured you a drink.

909
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:51,946
I do something wrong?

910
01:10:53,849 --> 01:10:55,717
Yeah, you did.

911
01:10:58,254 --> 01:10:59,988
Cheers.

912
01:11:09,665 --> 01:11:13,868
I had a long talk
with honest John.

913
01:11:29,752 --> 01:11:31,352
I did it
because I thought

914
01:11:31,354 --> 01:11:32,754
they'd break
my arms and legs,

915
01:11:32,756 --> 01:11:34,322
maybe kill me
if I didn't.

916
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,993
If I try to tell you
the whole story,

917
01:11:38,995 --> 01:11:42,664
it's just gonna sound
like some pathetic attempt
at an excuse, right?

918
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:45,667
Fuck it.

919
01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:49,671
Go ahead and do it.

920
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:54,842
If I were you
i wouldn't push my luck!

921
01:11:54,844 --> 01:11:58,413
How did you get involved
with these shits?

922
01:11:58,415 --> 01:12:01,416
Oh, god, I met a guy.

923
01:12:01,418 --> 01:12:03,484
<i> He was one of honest John's</i>
<i> bodyguards.</i>

924
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:05,653
<i> He's big, mean, and no good.</i>
<i> Just my type.</i>

925
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:07,555
<i> He went to go work</i>
<i> for the doctor,</i>

926
01:12:07,557 --> 01:12:09,657
<i> and he talked me into making</i>
<i> some extra money.</i>

927
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:11,993
I provided the drugs.

928
01:12:11,995 --> 01:12:15,063
<i> Anything the doctor couldn't</i>
<i> get without a prescription,</i>

929
01:12:15,065 --> 01:12:16,998
<i> I had plenty of access to</i>
<i> at the hospital.</i>

930
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,934
<i> You'd be amazed how easy</i>
<i>it is for me to grab the stuff.</i>

931
01:12:19,936 --> 01:12:22,937
<i> I really am a nurse.</i>
<i> I want you to get that.</i>

932
01:12:22,939 --> 01:12:25,740
I really needed the money
and they paid a lot and...

933
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:29,444
I only met the doctor
a few times.

934
01:12:29,446 --> 01:12:31,479
I never did know
her real name.

935
01:12:31,481 --> 01:12:34,882
<i> She told me</i>
<i> what she was doing</i>
<i> wasn't exactly by the book</i>

936
01:12:34,884 --> 01:12:37,051
<i> but she said</i>
<i> that they would be</i>
<i> making experiments</i>

937
01:12:37,053 --> 01:12:38,720
<i> that would be helping</i>
<i> a lot of people</i>

938
01:12:38,722 --> 01:12:40,054
<i> and she's a real doctor</i>

939
01:12:40,056 --> 01:12:41,756
<i> and a good talker</i>
<i> and let's face it,</i>

940
01:12:41,758 --> 01:12:45,059
<i> it was a really</i>
<i> fucked-up period in my life.</i>

941
01:12:47,096 --> 01:12:49,764
I usually got my orders
from Albert.

942
01:12:49,766 --> 01:12:51,366
<i> He's a nurse,</i>
<i> but not like me.</i>

943
01:12:51,368 --> 01:12:52,734
<i> He's a surgical nurse.</i>

944
01:12:52,736 --> 01:12:54,569
<i> They're a lot</i>
<i> more skilled, okay?</i>

945
01:12:54,571 --> 01:12:57,505
<i> He's-- oh, god,</i>
<i> he's a bastard. Real mean.</i>

946
01:12:57,507 --> 01:13:00,541
He did hard time
for some sex charge.

947
01:13:00,543 --> 01:13:02,777
He's got this deal
with the doctor.

948
01:13:02,779 --> 01:13:05,580
He's real hung up on hookers,
and she pays for them.

949
01:13:05,582 --> 01:13:08,583
I guess it's a reward
for his good work.

950
01:13:08,585 --> 01:13:10,418
He likes 'em
kinda kinky, you know?

951
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:11,686
Real exotic.

952
01:13:15,524 --> 01:13:17,525
What about me?

953
01:13:17,527 --> 01:13:21,562
I'm just supposed
to keep an eye on you.

954
01:13:21,564 --> 01:13:25,133
<i> Albert's called a few times</i>
<i> to check in so far, that's it.</i>

955
01:13:26,635 --> 01:13:28,836
End of story.

956
01:13:28,838 --> 01:13:31,038
The safe thing to do...

957
01:13:32,542 --> 01:13:34,842
Is to kill you.

958
01:13:57,901 --> 01:14:02,003
<i> I didn't kill her,</i>
<i> but it was goodbye Johnnie.</i>

959
01:14:02,005 --> 01:14:04,105
<i> I gave her some dough</i>

960
01:14:04,107 --> 01:14:07,842
and I put her on a bus to Reno
the next morning.

961
01:14:07,844 --> 01:14:10,077
She had some friends there.

962
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:11,846
I told her to give me
three weeks.

963
01:14:11,848 --> 01:14:14,215
If she didn't hear from me,
she could come back

964
01:14:14,217 --> 01:14:17,018
to her place
and I'll be long gone.

965
01:15:08,203 --> 01:15:09,770
Poncho.

966
01:15:16,812 --> 01:15:18,546
<i> Gracias,</i> huh?

967
01:15:19,882 --> 01:15:21,582
<i> Mucho.</i>

968
01:15:24,286 --> 01:15:26,954
<i> When I put Johnnie</i>
<i> on the bus, I told her</i>

969
01:15:26,956 --> 01:15:29,891
<i> to make a phone call</i>
<i> for me from Reno.</i>

970
01:15:29,893 --> 01:15:32,293
<i> She promised</i>
<i> she wouldn't let me down.</i>

971
01:15:32,295 --> 01:15:34,262
<i> I believed her.</i>

972
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:49,303
Hello, sweetie.

973
01:16:49,305 --> 01:16:52,039
Well, they said
you were a hottie.

974
01:16:52,041 --> 01:16:54,342
Just my type.

975
01:16:54,344 --> 01:16:57,912
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
take it easy, take it easy,

976
01:16:57,914 --> 01:17:00,615
nobody's gotta get hurt.

977
01:17:00,617 --> 01:17:02,950
Did you really think we
were gonna fuckin' fall

978
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:06,020
for that phone call
from Johnnie?

979
01:17:06,022 --> 01:17:07,922
Bring her over here.

980
01:17:13,362 --> 01:17:15,229
Hold her still.

981
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:25,206
Nighty night.

982
01:18:15,924 --> 01:18:17,291
Wow.

983
01:18:17,293 --> 01:18:21,829
It looks like the new model
frank kitchen.

984
01:18:21,831 --> 01:18:24,932
Well, frank, I hope
you got some rest.

985
01:18:24,934 --> 01:18:26,167
Hey, frank.

986
01:18:26,169 --> 01:18:28,836
If you get thirsty
you can crawl over here.

987
01:18:28,838 --> 01:18:31,038
Thank you, Albert.
That will be all.

988
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:40,448
It might interest
you to know, frank,

989
01:18:40,450 --> 01:18:43,718
that this old hotel
was the site

990
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:46,787
of many, many
a sinful party

991
01:18:46,789 --> 01:18:50,224
back around the time
of the big earthquake.

992
01:18:50,226 --> 01:18:52,393
All the rich people

993
01:18:52,395 --> 01:18:54,395
used to dance
and romance there.

994
01:18:54,397 --> 01:18:57,298
If these walls
could talk...

995
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:03,771
Much better.

996
01:19:03,773 --> 01:19:06,207
You need
a more natural look

997
01:19:06,209 --> 01:19:08,743
to bring out
your best features.

998
01:19:08,745 --> 01:19:11,045
I did a good job
on you, didn't I?

999
01:19:11,047 --> 01:19:13,447
You're really
quite beautiful

1000
01:19:13,449 --> 01:19:16,117
in a waitress/
shopgirl kind of way.

1001
01:19:16,119 --> 01:19:18,986
But I don't want
to be picky.

1002
01:19:18,988 --> 01:19:22,923
You certainly qualify
as an attractive woman.

1003
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:24,892
But inside your head,

1004
01:19:24,894 --> 01:19:28,062
I can see you really haven't
made any progress.

1005
01:19:28,064 --> 01:19:30,131
Still a killer.

1006
01:19:30,133 --> 01:19:32,166
Still a street animal.

1007
01:19:32,168 --> 01:19:34,502
Still a macho man.

1008
01:19:34,504 --> 01:19:36,837
I gave you a new
chance in life

1009
01:19:36,839 --> 01:19:39,306
and you wasted
that opportunity.

1010
01:19:39,308 --> 01:19:43,210
I realize you don't understand
what this is all about.

1011
01:19:43,212 --> 01:19:47,348
Such a complicated series
of events and misfortunes.

1012
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:51,185
I'm just wasting
words with you.

1013
01:19:51,187 --> 01:19:54,121
Surgery at 10:00 tonight.

1014
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:34,061
hello, frank.

1015
01:20:34,063 --> 01:20:36,497
Get him undressed
while I get set up.

1016
01:20:36,499 --> 01:20:38,432
I got three injections
to give him.

1017
01:20:38,434 --> 01:20:41,502
I don't wanna check his
blood pressure until he's out.

1018
01:20:41,504 --> 01:20:44,371
You're lucky to have such
a good surgeon, frank.

1019
01:20:44,373 --> 01:20:47,374
I'm sure she'll do
an excellent job on your arm.

1020
01:20:47,376 --> 01:20:51,011
Oh, I spoiled
the surprise.

1021
01:20:51,013 --> 01:20:53,480
She's gonna take your right arm
off at the shoulder

1022
01:20:53,482 --> 01:20:55,316
and give you a nice
little flipper.

1023
01:20:55,318 --> 01:20:56,383
Just like a seal.

1024
01:20:56,385 --> 01:20:59,119
Fuck, I can do it!

1025
01:20:59,121 --> 01:21:01,455
Won't be holding a gun
with that hand anymore.

1026
01:21:03,091 --> 01:21:07,027
The doctor seems to think
that's a good thing.

1027
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:09,964
Makes the world
a safer place.

1028
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:13,067
<i> I'm a cold guy.</i>

1029
01:21:13,069 --> 01:21:14,602
You make a living
the way I do,

1030
01:21:14,604 --> 01:21:17,071
you learn to keep
a hold of yourself.

1031
01:21:17,073 --> 01:21:21,475
You panic, you make mistakes,
you're dead.

1032
01:21:27,249 --> 01:21:29,383
Nice tits, huh?

1033
01:21:29,385 --> 01:21:30,918
She did a good job.

1034
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:36,090
Why don't you take
a look at this?

1035
01:21:36,092 --> 01:21:38,192
Bet you haven't
seen one of these

1036
01:21:38,194 --> 01:21:41,228
that you didn't have
to pay for in a long time.

1037
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:53,233
Aah!

1038
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:05,446
I think you're
out of bullets.

1039
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:21,128
So, what do we do now?

1040
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:29,236
I think I'm actually
a bit of a coward

1041
01:23:29,238 --> 01:23:33,173
when it comes to life
and death situations.

1042
01:23:34,409 --> 01:23:37,077
I assume the men
who work for me are...

1043
01:23:37,079 --> 01:23:38,579
Dead.

1044
01:23:42,751 --> 01:23:44,518
I have an idea.

1045
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:48,055
I think we should
call it quits.

1046
01:23:48,057 --> 01:23:50,791
You walk away
into the night,

1047
01:23:50,793 --> 01:23:53,627
I'll pull
a disappearing act of my own,

1048
01:23:53,629 --> 01:23:59,033
and, sad to say, we'll never
see each other again.

1049
01:23:59,035 --> 01:24:00,634
Over.

1050
01:24:00,636 --> 01:24:02,302
Quits.

1051
01:24:04,472 --> 01:24:06,373
I don't think so.

1052
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:11,211
You see, you never know
when you're gonna need
one of these.

1053
01:24:14,482 --> 01:24:16,650
I can't believe it.

1054
01:24:19,387 --> 01:24:21,488
Everything's coming apart.

1055
01:24:23,192 --> 01:24:25,259
All my work.

1056
01:24:25,261 --> 01:24:27,094
Falling to pieces.

1057
01:24:32,267 --> 01:24:35,669
Do you like
my little humidifier?

1058
01:24:35,671 --> 01:24:39,706
It's uh... 150 years old.

1059
01:24:39,708 --> 01:24:41,608
Made in Edinburgh.

1060
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:44,178
Still runs
like a charm.

1061
01:24:46,448 --> 01:24:48,148
Don't shoot me, frank.

1062
01:24:50,285 --> 01:24:52,286
I never beg,

1063
01:24:52,288 --> 01:24:56,356
but so much of what I do
is for the good.

1064
01:25:19,314 --> 01:25:22,316
After I wiped my prints,

1065
01:25:22,318 --> 01:25:25,519
there was just one more thing
i had to do.

1066
01:25:49,744 --> 01:25:51,612
<i> I called the cops</i>
<i> from a phone</i>

1067
01:25:51,614 --> 01:25:54,414
<i> in the back of the bar</i>
<i> about a block away.</i>

1068
01:25:54,416 --> 01:25:56,316
<i> I told them to send</i>
<i> an ambulance over</i>

1069
01:25:56,318 --> 01:25:59,253
<i> to take care</i>
<i> of the doctor.</i>

1070
01:25:59,255 --> 01:26:01,455
<i> There wasn't any trial.</i>

1071
01:26:01,457 --> 01:26:03,624
<i> It wasn't even too big</i>
<i> a story in the paper</i>

1072
01:26:03,626 --> 01:26:05,492
<i> or on the news.</i>

1073
01:26:05,494 --> 01:26:09,163
<i> They just sent the doctor</i>
<i> off to the nut house.</i>

1074
01:26:20,441 --> 01:26:21,675
Hello, Ralph.

1075
01:26:21,677 --> 01:26:23,677
Doctor.

1076
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:26,280
You've come
to say goodbye.

1077
01:26:26,282 --> 01:26:29,616
Yes, yes, I have.

1078
01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:34,388
Before we say sweet
sentimental things
to each other,

1079
01:26:34,390 --> 01:26:36,857
I have to ask
what you thought of
yesterday's hearing.

1080
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:39,359
I thought it was
cheap theatrics

1081
01:26:39,361 --> 01:26:41,828
by someone desperate
for attention.

1082
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:46,500
And finally I thought it was
a performance of no consequence.

1083
01:26:46,502 --> 01:26:49,369
What I see is simply
a doctor who broke her oath,

1084
01:26:49,371 --> 01:26:51,338
a doctor who was found
in a building

1085
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:52,706
with four dead bodies--

1086
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:54,308
I killed none
of the four.

1087
01:26:54,310 --> 01:26:56,543
No, your surrogate
Albert Becker did,

1088
01:26:56,545 --> 01:26:57,844
but you built
the theater

1089
01:26:57,846 --> 01:26:59,479
where the tragedy
could play out.

1090
01:26:59,481 --> 01:27:00,881
Bullshit.

1091
01:27:00,883 --> 01:27:03,784
Albert was no angel,
but he never killed anyone.

1092
01:27:04,819 --> 01:27:06,453
You invented
frank kitchen

1093
01:27:06,455 --> 01:27:09,489
to protect the memory
of Albert Becker.

1094
01:27:09,491 --> 01:27:11,992
I tried to help
frank kitchen,

1095
01:27:11,994 --> 01:27:15,529
but the fact remains
he killed all four,

1096
01:27:15,531 --> 01:27:20,934
then he shot me,
and proceeded to do
other vile things.

1097
01:27:20,936 --> 01:27:23,237
You're
completely wrong.

1098
01:27:23,239 --> 01:27:25,572
It makes me
so angry and sad.

1099
01:27:26,674 --> 01:27:28,609
Goodbye, Ralph.

1100
01:27:29,677 --> 01:27:31,378
I see. I see.

1101
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:34,948
You show me once again
how very clever you are,

1102
01:27:34,950 --> 01:27:37,851
and then-- then it's
<i> adios muchacho.</i>

1103
01:27:37,853 --> 01:27:40,354
Mm. No, not that easy.

1104
01:27:40,356 --> 01:27:44,358
I wanna know what you've
been trying to pull off
from the get-go.

1105
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:47,828
What's your agenda?

1106
01:27:47,830 --> 01:27:51,031
I'm just gonna
stand here...

1107
01:27:51,033 --> 01:27:53,300
Until I get an answer.

1108
01:27:54,869 --> 01:27:56,436
All right.

1109
01:27:58,373 --> 01:28:01,775
It took me a long time
to recover from my wounds,

1110
01:28:01,777 --> 01:28:04,044
but after two years
in this hell hole

1111
01:28:04,046 --> 01:28:06,580
I decided to put up
a fight.

1112
01:28:06,582 --> 01:28:09,483
If you could be
manipulated properly,

1113
01:28:09,485 --> 01:28:11,885
maybe I'd get out of
this miserable facility

1114
01:28:11,887 --> 01:28:14,688
and rightly end up
in front of a judge and jury.

1115
01:28:14,690 --> 01:28:18,692
I'd hire myself some
hotshot lawyers

1116
01:28:18,694 --> 01:28:21,962
and hope for 12 men
and women, good and true,

1117
01:28:21,964 --> 01:28:25,699
who would appreciate my vision
of a a better world.

1118
01:28:25,701 --> 01:28:27,434
I buy the plan.

1119
01:28:27,436 --> 01:28:29,403
But you blew it
in the hearing.

1120
01:28:29,405 --> 01:28:32,439
After I lost my temper
and attacked you,

1121
01:28:32,441 --> 01:28:34,975
I knew it was game over.

1122
01:28:34,977 --> 01:28:38,545
A trial would be
one long misery
with a predictable end,

1123
01:28:38,547 --> 01:28:42,416
resulting in an even
greater humiliation.

1124
01:28:42,418 --> 01:28:45,986
So I decided
to accept my fate,

1125
01:28:45,988 --> 01:28:49,690
but I wanted there to be
a statement of the truth.

1126
01:28:49,692 --> 01:28:51,992
I wanted it to be
on the record

1127
01:28:51,994 --> 01:28:56,496
in case anyone ever cares
to look for the facts.

1128
01:28:56,498 --> 01:29:00,434
Now I'll return to my books
and my private thoughts.

1129
01:29:00,436 --> 01:29:03,337
Goodbye to out there
and all that.

1130
01:29:03,339 --> 01:29:04,871
Goodnight, room.

1131
01:29:04,873 --> 01:29:06,907
Goodnight, moon.

1132
01:29:06,909 --> 01:29:09,376
Go fuck yourself, Ralph.

1133
01:29:09,378 --> 01:29:13,447
<i> Adios muchacho, </i>
and be on your way.

1134
01:29:16,484 --> 01:29:19,586
I still feel bad
about Johnnie.

1135
01:29:19,588 --> 01:29:23,757
Although she screwed me over,
i really liked her.

1136
01:29:23,759 --> 01:29:26,626
She stayed working
in Reno.

1137
01:29:26,628 --> 01:29:28,562
I think it was
the best thing for her.

1138
01:29:28,564 --> 01:29:33,367
A new city, new place to live,
a fresh start.

1139
01:29:33,369 --> 01:29:37,070
Yeah, I think it worked out
for the best.

1140
01:29:38,806 --> 01:29:41,375
One more thing.

1141
01:29:41,377 --> 01:29:43,610
<i> The doctor.</i>

1142
01:30:33,194 --> 01:30:35,729
<i> I used to be a guy.</i>

1143
01:30:35,731 --> 01:30:38,498
<i> A real bad guy.</i>

1144
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:41,034
<i> Then things changed.</i>

1145
01:30:41,036 --> 01:30:45,071
<i> Now I look at the cards</i>
<i>I got dealt in a different way.</i>

1146
01:30:45,073 --> 01:30:47,607
<i> One thing's for sure.</i>

1147
01:30:47,609 --> 01:30:49,643
<i> Change is gonna come.</i>
